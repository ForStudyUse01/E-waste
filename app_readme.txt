   - User-friendly navigation

Technical Implementation
-----------------------
1. Backend (Flask)
   - Python 3.x
   - Flask web framework
   - OpenCV for image processing
   - Matplotlib for data visualization
   - JSON file-based user storage

2. Frontend
   - HTML5
   - CSS3 with Bootstrap 5
   - JavaScript for interactive features
   - AJAX for asynchronous requests

3. Security Features
   - Password hashing
   - Secure file handling
   - Session management
   - Input validation
   - XSS protection

4. File Structure
   /static
     /uploads (temporary file storage)
     /css (stylesheet files)
   /templates
     base.html (main template)
     index.html (home page)
     scan.html (e-waste analysis)
     centers.html (recycling centers)
     rewards.html (rewards page)
     login.html (login form)
     signup.html (registration form)
   app.py (main application)
   ai_analyzer.py (AI analysis module)
   users.json (user data storage)

Authentication Flow
-----------------
1. Registration
   - User fills out registration form
   - System validates input
   - Password is hashed
   - User data is stored in users.json
   - User is automatically logged in

2. Login
   - User enters credentials
   - System verifies against stored data
   - Session is created on success
   - User is redirected to home page

3. Protected Routes
   - @login_required decorator checks session
   - Unauthorized users are redirected to login
   - Session data persists across pages

Points System
------------
1. Earning Points
   - Points awarded for device analysis
   - Points based on recyclability score
   - Points stored in user session and JSON file

2. Using Points
   - Points can be redeemed for rewards
   - Points balance is checked before redemption
   - Points are deducted after successful redemption

Error Handling
-------------
1. File Upload
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - Secure filename handling
   - Temporary file cleanup

2. Authentication
   - Invalid credentials handling
   - Duplicate email prevention
   - Password confirmation validation

3. Analysis
   - Image processing errors
   - Analysis failure handling
   - Chart generation errors

Development Notes
----------------
1. Dependencies
   - Flask
   - OpenCV
   - Matplotlib
   - Werkzeug
   - scikit-learn

2. Configuration
   - Debug mode enabled
   - Secret key for session security
   - Upload folder configuration
   - Allowed file types

3. Future Improvements
   - Database integration
   - Enhanced AI analysis
   - Email verification
   - Password reset functionality
   - Social media integration

Usage Instructions
----------------
1. Start the application:
   python app.py

2. Access the application:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000

3. Create an account:
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Fill in required information
   - Submit the form

4. Analyze e-waste:
   - Log in to your account
   - Navigate to "Scan E-Waste"
   - Upload an image
   - View analysis results

5. Redeem rewards:
   - Earn points through analysis
   - Visit the rewards page
   - Select and redeem rewards

Security Considerations
---------------------
1. Password Security
   - Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug
   - Plain text passwords are never stored
   - Password confirmation required

2. File Security
   - Secure filename handling
   - File type validation
   - Temporary file cleanup
   - Upload size limits

3. Session Security
   - Session-based authentication
